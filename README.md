## Spam Detection with Neural Network vs Decision trees

This is the repository where I use the dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository to train the models 4-Layer Neural Network (DNN) and Decision Trees to compare which one is more effective.

### Dataset information:  
5572 rows with two columns, each for lable and the text message  

### Steps to procedure:  
#### 1. Import the libraries and the dataset  
#### 2. Data Exploration
#### 3. Clean the data
#### Step 4. Transform the data
#### Step 5. Train the data
#### Step 6. Evalute the model

# Final Result
## 4-Layer Neural Network (DNN): Accuracy: 99.10%  
## Decision Trees: Accuracy: 97.13%
#### From the test above, we can see that both of the models Neural Network and Decision Trees makes very high prediction accuracy for this small dataset with fine-tuning
